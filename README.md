📘 README – Custom Discord Activity
🖥 What Is This?
Custom Discord Activity is a fully customizable Rich Presence tool that lets you control your own Discord status — complete with buttons, images, and detailed info — without needing to code.

No bots. No dev tools. Just plug in your info and you're live.

🚀 Setup Guide
1. ✅ Create Your Own Discord Application
You need your own Discord Application Client ID to use this tool.
Here’s how to get one:

Go to: https://discord.com/developers/applications

Click "New Application"

Name it something like My Custom Presence

Copy the Application (Client) ID — you'll paste this into the app

2. 🖼 Add Custom Image Assets (Optional)
Inside your newly created Discord Application, click "Rich Presence" → "Art Assets"

Upload your image(s)

Format: .png or .jpg

Must be 512x512 or smaller

Give each image a unique name (no spaces)

In the Custom Activity app, type that image name into the Image Key box

🧠 Example: If you upload an image called jb_logo, enter jb_logo in the app.

3. ⚙️ Using the App
Launch the Custom Activity app

Fill in:

Client ID (from Step 1)

Details – your top line of text

State – your second line

Image Key – matches what you uploaded

(Optional) Button Label + URL

Your Discord profile will instantly update.

4. 💾 Auto Save + Themes
